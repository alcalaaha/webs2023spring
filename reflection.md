For this project, I feel that I have met all the baseline criteria. I have five separate pages, each with a clear navigation panel at the top that shows which page 
the viewer is currently on. My CSS sheet is sitewide, and is overridden in the case of the installations page, where I altered the background color and image order 
to fit the artwork shown. Fortunately, all the images and artwork featured on this website are created by Jin, so I had no issues with crediting. In my original plan, 
I wanted to add some background noises, but with the clean, minimalist aesthetic I ended up with, I felt that it would be too out of place. However, I did import a 
few pieces from Jin’s installation works which are video files, adding something new to break the monotony of picture after picture.

Something that has really annoyed me is that I have been unable to get autoplay to work for the videos. All other commands I tested out with sizing, muting, or 
adding/removing the controls all work, but the autoplay doesn’t and it changes the flow. However, it might be for the best, as entering a website page and 
immediately being met with flashing colors and images could be unhealthy for some, and the lack of autoplay gives them a choice. I also played around with adding 
a custom cursor image, but after following three or four different tutorials, I decided to leave that for my future self. If I did end up being able to use the image 
I wanted, it would be the only thing in this website not credited to Jin. If I had more time, I would definitely spend it formatting the images so that when I hovered 
over them, they would enlarge. Someone mentioned that in my feedback and I thought it was a really cool idea, but I couldn’t get my brain around how to do that 
without messing up the way I set up the page, so I’ll have to come back to that at some point.

I plan to work more on this website when Jin visits me over the summer, so we can have a more presentable project for something planning to base their career in the 
arts. Much of the feedback I got in class said that they liked the basic background and interface, as it puts more emphasis on the artwork, but I have a feeling that
Jin also wants the website to be a work of art itself, reflecting their own style. They have also let me know that they are already planning a second website 
specifically for their written works, so I will be trying to teach them what I learned from this experience, so they can do some parts on their own.
