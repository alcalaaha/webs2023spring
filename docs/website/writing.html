      <img src="images/it zine.JPEG" alt="A rectangular zine cover, with a background of white, 
      blue, and red paint strokes. The title is printed with varying fonts and each letter is separated 
      from the next as if it were a ransom note. The bottom left corner has the word 'by' and the right
      has the word 'Jove,' crediting the author.">
      <p><b>Intrusive Thing</b></p>
      <p>A short collaged zine with a simple mantra.</p>

      <img src="images/zine.JPEG" alt="A black and white image of the artist has been cut into squares and
      moved around, but to the point where it still resembles a human face. In all caps, above their right 
      eye it reads 'Notes on' and below the left reads 'a name heist.'">
      <p><b>Notes on a Name Heist</b></p>
      <p>An abstract memoir on the author’s experience with brownness, queerness, and the effects of growing up in an immigrant household–a not so detailed tutorial on changing your own name.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item">
      <img src="images/tigz1 zine.png" alt="The title 'Thing is god,' made up of different fonts and cut
      out letters in the ransom note style as the first zine is place in front of a topless female figure.
      Instead of a head, a depiction of the virgin Mary holding baby Jesus, below them a necklace of eyes,
      and in the areas surrounding them are cherub-like figure and angels. All images in this zine cover have been placed
      together as a digital collage.">
      <p><b>Thing is God</b></p>
      <p>An epic poem about the fantastic and tragic nature of queer love.
