      The model sits on the floor against a white backdrop, with the piece draped over their shoulders.
      String of pearls is comprised of multiple hand-made, circular pieces of paper dyed green, and attached
      to yarn to make a shawl-like object.">

      <img src="images/IMG_3569.JPG" alt="This image is of the piece 'Pink Jasmine.' Like the previous work,
      this one is another wearble piece. The model is shown jumping in the air as the image captures the pink-tinted
      pieces of paper shaped like flowers as they move about in the air like vines.">

      <img src="images/DSC_0041.jpg" alt="This is the second image depicting the String of Pearls. This time,

      as they fall over the model's back">
