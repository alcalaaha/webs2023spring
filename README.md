# Project 3: Website Portfolio

This website is a portfolio for my friend Jin, who is a student as MassArt. The pieces they've created so far fall into the categories of fiber arts, installation work, and writing, so I have separate pages for each. Currently, I am having trouble connecting each of these pages, so at this point you will have to click on each page from github, not the navigation links. I'm still working on the video portion and trying to make it look more presentable and I plan to have the videos blend into the background better as well as autoplay, so be nice to me there :'). In the future, I also plan to match the color pallete of the page to the artwork shown.
