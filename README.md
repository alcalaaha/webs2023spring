# Project 3: Website Portfolio

This website is a portfolio for my friend Jin, who is a student as MassArt. The pieces they've created so far fall into the categories of fiber arts, installation work, and writing, so I have separate pages for each. Their "about me" page contains little information on them, and the images I've included thoughout the website obscure their face in a way that creates a sense of mystery and anonymity, and allows the viewer to focus their attention on their artwork rather than the artist.

In order to access my website, go into the docs folder -> website, and there you will find the pages for the site. Start at index.html !
