# Project 3: Website Portfolio

This website is a portfolio for my friend Jin, who is a student as MassArt. The pieces they've created so far fall into the categories of fiber arts, installation work, and writing, so I have separate pages for each. I'm still working on the video portion and trying to make it look more presentable while getting autoplay to work, so be nice to me there :'). The About Me is also a wip, but I will fully add it after peer reviews, as they don't want all their information public yet. In the future, I also plan to change the fonts, add descriptions/info for each piece, and match the color palette of the page to the artwork shown.

In order to access my website, go into the docs folder -> website, and there you will find the pages for the site.
